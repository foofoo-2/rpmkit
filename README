Here are some rpm related scripts distributed under GPLv3+/GPLv2+.

* COPYING.GPLv3: license file
* README: this file
* list-requires-by-package-name.sh: list required rpms by package name
* list-srpmnames-by-file.sh: list names of src.rpms by file
* rpm2json.py: dump json expression of rpm metadata
* rpms2sqldb.py: scan rpm files and generated metadata database (sqlite)
* swapi.py: cui tool to call Spacewalk/RHN RPC API from command line


NOTES
========================

* filelist2rpm.py and xpack.py were removed as these are replaced with its
  successor, pmaker.py

* pmaker.py: I decided to make and maintain in a decicated git repo for
  packagemaker (pmaker). This script (legacy version now) will be kept for a
  while but will not be updated any more.  Please look at the new repository of
  packagemaker (pmaker) at:
