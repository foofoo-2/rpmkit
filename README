About
=======================

Here are some rpm related scripts distributed under GPLv3+/GPLv2+.

* README: this file
* list-requires-by-package-name.sh: list required rpms by package name
* list-srpmnames-by-file.sh: list names of src.rpms by file
* rpm2json.py: dump json expression of rpm metadata
* rpms2sqldb.py: scan rpm files and generated metadata database (sqlite)
* swapi.py: cui tool to call Spacewalk/RHN RPC API from command line



Build
=======================

Build w/ mock
------------------------

It takes some time to make a rpm but should be better, I think.

1. python setup.py srpm
2. mock -r <target_build_dist> dist/SRPMS/packagemaker-*.src.rpm


Build w/o mock
------------------------

It's easier than the above but only possible to make a rpm for build host.

1. python setup.py rpm


TODO
========================

* Write tests:

  * myrepo:

    * config.py
    * cui.py
    * repo.py
    * repoops.py


NOTES
========================

* filelist2rpm.py and xpack.py were removed as these are replaced with its
  successor, pmaker.py

* pmaker.py: I created other decicated git repo for it and renamed to
  packagemaker (pmaker). This script (legacy version now) will be kept for a
  while but will not be mantained any more.  Please look at the new repository
  of packagemaker (pmaker) at:
