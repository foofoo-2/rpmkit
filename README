About
=======================

GPL3+/GPLv2+/MIT.

* identrpm: Identify given rpm and print info

* rpms2sqldb: Create SQLite database of given rpms metadata

  * list-requires-by-package-name.sh: List requirements for given rpm name[s],

Build
=======================

Build w/ mock
------------------------

It takes some time to make a rpm but should be better, I think.

1. python setup.py srpm
2. mock -r <target_build_dist> dist/SRPMS/packagemaker-*.src.rpm


Build w/o mock
------------------------

It's easier than the above but only possible to make a rpm for build host.

1. python setup.py rpm


TODO
========================

* Write tests
* Fix PEP8 warnings and errors


NOTES
========================

* filelist2rpm.py and xpack.py were removed as these are replaced with its
  successor, pmaker.py

* pmaker.py: I created other decicated git repo for it and renamed to
  packagemaker (pmaker). This script (legacy version now) will be kept for a
  while but will not be mantained any more.  Please look at the new repository
  of packagemaker (pmaker) at:

  https://github.com/ssato/packagemaker/

* myrepo: Exported to another project:

  https://github.com/ssato/python-myrepo/
